# What is this
Syncro is an CLI tool to that helps you to syncronize files between multiple folders.

Why? The reason that I'm creating this is because I want help to mantain my dotfiles repository. 
My dotfiles must live in their respective place (which is usually .config) and the repository
folder. This program helps me to do so.

Maybe it will be also useful if you want to automatically create security copies of files between
diferent disks.

# Is it ready to be used?

following command.
